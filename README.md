# api-mount

Aggregated module is under construction but you can find it in the form of 2 packages:

- [api-mount-server](http://npmjs.com/package/api-mount-server)
- [api-mount-client](http://npmjs.com/package/api-mount-client)

The goal of _api-mount_ is to make back-end API accessible in front-end as easily as simply calling a method.
